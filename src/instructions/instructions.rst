:summary: How to install anaconda, github, gitkraken, and how to accept an assignment
:tags: instructions, confusing


========
Anaconda
========

 1. This is the programming environment we will be using
 2. Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_  Make sure you get the python 3.7 version appropriate for your operating system.  Talk to Mark immediately if you have problems with the download or the installation. Nick will be available to help deal with any installation issues outside of class.
 


=========
gitkraken
=========

 1. This is the local client we will use to access shared files and programs.  Git and gitkraken allow us to keep the history of changes to a set of files and to manage storing and retrieving those files from a server in the cloud, rather than on your local computer.





 1. This is the day we actually got to working through the first data project.  Upon completion, you should have:

   * access to schoology, the course website, anaconda navigator, jupyter lab, and gitkraken
   * cloned a copy of your project1 repository to your computer using gitkraken
   * walked through the election data using jupyter lab, running all of the code cells, and adding comments in markdown cells
   * saved your changes to the explore_election.ipynb file using jupyter lab
   * used gitkraken to **commit** your changes to the file to the local copy of your repository (this means storing the change permanently)
   * used gitkraken to submit your work on the project by **pushing** it to github.  This allows me to see and comment on your work.

 2.  All of this was a bit confusing, because there are several different websites and tools we are using, and several different kinds of things we are doign with them.  It would be natural to feel a bit unsure of what we did at this point, so don't be concerned if you are unsure -- we will practice and talk through it multiple times in the next few weeks until the whole process makes sense to everyone.

 3. That said, please feel free to ask questions or meet with me outside of class if you want to talk over any of it or to clarify.  In general, you should expect that there will be time to do all project work in the class during class time.

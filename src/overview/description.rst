Dealing with data is one of the most important aspects of making progress in any field -- from science to business to journalism.  Understanding the world requires understanding and manipulating data.  Students in this class will learn a popular open-source programming and data analysis software system that will enable them to explore, make inferences, and visualize data sets in informative ways.  Skills learned in this class will be widely applicable to many fields of study and future careers.  Prior programming experience is not required.


**General goals of the course and of the Computational Thinking requirement:**

We want graduates of our programs to embrace the opportunities to combine their imagination and modern computation to better understand the physical, social, intellectual and cultural worlds they inhabit and, as appropriate, to develop ways to improve them. Students will embrace the practice of overcoming barriers, testing ideas, and adjusting strategies.  We, as a community, believe that programs centered around purposeful problem solving strategies that leverage modern computing is becoming a fundamental skill in the 21st century throughout a variety of industries.  SAAS cultivates students to be adept in many areas that we believe to make them ready for the world ahead of them.  Fluency in computational problem solving will become a fundamental capability of successful students.

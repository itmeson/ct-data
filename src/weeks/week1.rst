=====
Day 1
=====

 1. The pace of change and the role of data 
 2. Get connected to our Github classroom.
 
    * Use the `invite code <https://classroom.github.com/a/piBXYIBA>`_. 
    * If you don't have a github account, you will be prompted to create one.
    * Send me an email telling me what username you used
    * You will follow the instructions in the "readme.md" file to do the assignment, but we will do most of it together.
    * The objective of this assignment is to make sure everyone has the programming environment installed successfuly and to get some practice using the notebook file format

 3. Intro survey
 4. Introduce yourself and say a bit about your interests and goals
 5. Sticky notes - questions you are interested in answering, if you just had the data.

Day 2
=====

 1. How the class is going to work
 2. Install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_  Make sure you get the python 3.7 version appropriate for your operating system.  Talk to Mark immediately if you have problems with the download or the installation. Nick will be available to help deal with any installation issues outside of class.
 3. Start doing first assignment

Day 3
=====

 1. This is the day we actually got to working through the first data project.  Upon completion, you should have:

   * access to schoology, the course website, anaconda navigator, jupyter lab, and gitkraken
   * cloned a copy of your project1 repository to your computer using gitkraken
   * walked through the election data using jupyter lab, running all of the code cells, and adding comments in markdown cells
   * saved your changes to the explore_election.ipynb file using jupyter lab
   * used gitkraken to **commit** your changes to the file to the local copy of your repository (this means storing the change permanently)
   * used gitkraken to submit your work on the project by **pushing** it to github.  This allows me to see and comment on your work.

 2.  All of this was a bit confusing, because there are several different websites and tools we are using, and several different kinds of things we are doign with them.  It would be natural to feel a bit unsure of what we did at this point, so don't be concerned if you are unsure -- we will practice and talk through it multiple times in the next few weeks until the whole process makes sense to everyone.

 3. That said, please feel free to ask questions or meet with me outside of class if you want to talk over any of it or to clarify.  In general, you should expect that there will be time to do all project work in the class during class time.

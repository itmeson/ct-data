=====
Day 1
=====

 1. On a whiteboard, with a partner, draw out a flowchart of the steps involved in computing the average of a data set.  Make it neat and readable, I will be taking pictures of them

 2. On a whiteboard, with a partner, draw out a flowchart of the steps involved in finding the *maximum* value in a data set.  Again make it neat and readable as I will be taking pictures of them.

 3. Continue working on project 3 -- we have a few people finished, but it looks like most still have some work to finish it.

Day 2
=====

 1. On a whiteboard, with a partner, write the output that will be produced by each of these programs.  After Mark has checked your work, you can copy them into a jupyter notebook and try them out.

.. code-block:: python

 # Program 1
 for i in range(10):
     print(i)


.. code-block:: python
 
 # Program 2
 total = 0
 for i in range(10):
     total = total + i
     print(total)


.. code-block:: python

 # Program 3
 total = 0
 for i in range(10):
     total = total + i
 print(total)


.. code-block:: python

 # Program 4
 total = 0
 for i in range(10):
     total = total + i
 print(total)
     print("Hello")
..


 2. `Project 4 <https://classroom.github.com/a/7Kurw_ns>`_.  The idea of this project is to make sure everyone understands the basic patterns of importing data, inspecting it, accessing rows, columns, entries, etc. so the tasks are shorter and more explicit in their instructions.  The last task in the project requires a new pattern that we will discuss together. 

   * Accept the assignment invitation by following the link
   * Open gitkraken, then clone the new reposity for project4, storing it in a local folder
   * Run anaconda navigator, then jupyter lab
   * Navigate to the code folder, open and run the file *explore_rentals.ipynb*
   * Do the work on that file, some of which we will do together and some independently.
   * Save the file when you are finished
   * Stage, commit, and push the changes using gitkraken

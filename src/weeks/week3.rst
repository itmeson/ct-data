Day 1
=====

 1. We're going to keep going on assignments from the repl.it site, stopping from time to time to take notes on important concepts that come up in the questions.  If you have done much programming before, then just keep making steady progress on the problems.  If you have not done much programming before, then **ASK QUESTIONS** -- Mark will be circulating the room trying to make sure everyone is able to make progress, and will stop to talk with the whole class whenever he thinks there's a question that will benefit everyone.  So if you ask questions, everyone will benefit.

 2.  Key concepts today:  variable, value, type, integer, float, string, input, output, operations

Day 2
=====

We're going to try an experiment for instant discussions -- we'll use this widget to tell me if you need help, to submit comments and discussions quickly, and to answer entrance and exit ticket items.

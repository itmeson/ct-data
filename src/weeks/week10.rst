What a week!

We're going to end up working on the repl.it assignments and the data analysis websites assignment for most of the class, but first there's two things I want you to take a look at:

 1. Take the following code and run it in the `pythontutor <http://pythontutor.com/live.html#mode=edit>`_.  It's a solution for problem 2.5 in the repl.it assignments, I'd like you to walk through it one step at a time and discuss how it works with a partner.  When you move on to do more of the repl.it assignments yourself, I'd like you to use the pythontutor site and a whiteboard to diagram how your solutions to a few of the problems work -- and then paste pictures of your whiteboard work into the google doc for that assignment.

.. code-block:: python

   # This program is supposed to compute the sum of the digits
   # of the input number.  It's problem 2.5 in the repl.it
   # assignments.

   a = int(input())
   # Print a value:

   print((a // 100) + ((a // 10) % 10) + (a % 10)) # makes the sum

   # break the sum down into parts
   print(a//100)
   print(a//10)
   print((a//10)%10)
   print(a%10)   


2. Read the article `The Two Codes Your Kids Need to Know <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/opinion/college-board-sat-ap.html>`_ and write some comments, responses, questions about it in the comment field on this page below.  If you have trouble accessing it I have a pdf I can share with you.

 3. Work on the repl.it assignments or the data analysis websites assignment.

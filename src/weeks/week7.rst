Day 2
=====

 1. In order to get a better understanding of what is going on in a program, we're going to back up and do some assignments with more specific tasks that are not necessarily data related, but will help with general understanding of using python to program.  We're going to use a tool called repl.it, which won't require you to install anything -- it will just run in your browser and you can work through the assignments at your own pace.  I will evaluate in a couple of days before setting any deadlines on these assignments.

 2. Go to the `invite link https://repl.it/classroom/invite/5WFb6VD <https://repl.it/classroom/invite/5WFb6VD>`_ , create an account and join the class.

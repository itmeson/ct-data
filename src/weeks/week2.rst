Day 1
=====

 1. We're going to start out with a project to examine the kinds of things other people have done with data analysis and visualization.  Some of the projects you will look at are amazing -- definitely goals to aspire toward even if we are not yet able to replicate the things they are doing.  But we do want to build a vocabulary about data and an appreciation for the possibilities.  I'm going to call this the "Information is Beautiful" project, after the website I'm sending you to.  It is a collection of award winning data visualizations.  The project for you will be to explore and analyze at least two of them, and write a short (page or twol long) explanation of what they did.  The document to submit will be available through schoology, and it will have prompts for what to write about as well as links to the site.
 2. Here's the site, `Information is Beautiful <https://informationisbeautiful.net/>`_

Day 2
=====

 1. Finish up the Information is Beautiful project.  Submit your work, and we will discuss as a class.  Mark will highlight a few of the selected projects.

 2. So how do you do that kind of thing yourself?  


=====
Day 3
=====

 1. We're going to look at the results of your class data entry, and ask questions about which variables are related to each other and issues with data entry
 2. I want you to write on a whiteboard explicit instructions for how to calculate the average of a set of numbers by hand
 3. We're going to walk through an example of a program that calculates the average of a set of numbers.  To do that, I'll be connecting you to an `online tool called repl.it <https://repl.it/classroom/invite/8TczF21>`_ where some of your assignments for the next few weeks will be kept. 
 4. Record some notes about what we've done this week in a google doc for this class.

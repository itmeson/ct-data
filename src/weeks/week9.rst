Day 3

 1. We're going to try to get an overview sense of what data analysis is about in the "real world", as we continue to gain programming skills and prepare to do some projects in the last couple of weeks of the course.

 2. The following are a collection of links to interesting resources explaining different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and things to think about.  I'd like you to explore each of them, taking notes in the schoology google doc.

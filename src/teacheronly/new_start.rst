Day 1

So far the class is unequivocally stronger than last year.  The three repeater students even seem to be learning quite a bit from this approach -- which is both a recommendation of the new ideas and an indictment of the old ones.

 1. Take a computational task that is understood well on an implicit level by most students, ie, they are able to accomplish this task (compute the average of a list of numbers) without any instruction.
 2. Ask them to explicitly plan out the steps involved in this task.  Most of them are unable to do this.
 3. Help them make the steps painfully explicit.
 4. Then ask them to describe the "main ideas" of these steps on a high level.  (Count; Add; Divide) vs. (storage for count, storage for total, loop, acquire data, check for end, add to total, add to count, divide)
 5. Live code how to perform this algorithm in python.
 6. Ask them to comment the program
 7. Use retrieval practice, what are the main ideas of computing the average? (count, add, divide) What is involved in one of those steps (the count step)  (initialize counter, loop, check for end, increment counter, end loop, stop)
 8. Add some vocabulary (data types, string, number, integer, float, conditional, loop)
 9. Repeat progression with MAXIMUM.  (Perform, describe on high level, describe explicitly, live code, describe on high level, vocabulary, document/comment, day off, describe on high level, move on)
 10. Repeat with MAXIMUM that can handle all negative numbers.
 11. Repeat with MINIMUM
 12. repeat with frequency
 13. More vocabulary
 14. Point out that mixing data input and computation at the same time is not very convenient for readability, debugging, extensibility, or reusability.
 15. Teach lists as a new data type to store the data
 16. Teach functions as a way to encapsulate one job in one piece of code
 17. Rewrite all the previous tasks as functions
 18. Make a data explorer using our functions
 19. Build more functions
 20. Plotting

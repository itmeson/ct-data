Alpha Go

Questions

 * Why games?
 * How did the Breakout AI figure out new strategies?
 * Why Go?
 * Demis Hassabis?
 * DeepMind
 * Mission to fundamentally understand intelligence and to recreate it artificially
 * Then use it to solve all kinds of problems
 * 2 years?
 * "Technically know what I'm allowed to do, but have no idea what I should do"
 * Number of configurations of the board -- compare chess to Go.  How do you know?
 * How is it trained?  Starting database of human played games
 * Go is one of the 4 accomplishments: music, poetry, and painting, and Go
 * How could AlphaGo lose "in a way that makes us look silly"?  (reminds me of things that happened with the Watson - Jeopardy challenge
 * Demis Hassabis -- professional chess player, 2nd highest rated in world.  Why did he stop?
 * How does it improve?
 * How does it have weaknesses? How did Fan Hui find it?  And was he able to reliably produce the "crazed" stuck positions to force AlphaGo into a weak state?
 * How many processors? They make it look like it's just one...
 * WHat is human intuition?  And How can it give humans an advantage?
 * Michael Redmond - 9p
 * How many of the programmers are Go players?  How good?  
 * One of the human advantages is to be able to read the opponent, to feel how they feel -- to have empathy.  Because there is no response from AlphaGo other than the move, it is impossible for the human player to "feel with" their opponent, and this can be demoralizing.
 * How does it look 50-60 moves ahead?  (How many board positions is that?)
 * It is very hard even for an expert to know who is ahead at any moment.
 * HUmans want humans to win, but AlphaGo is human created...  Humans created the initial program, the training data, etc.  -- but that is not true anymore when we move to AlphaZero.
 * Why do I feel so bad for Lee Sedol?
 * "AlphaGo is hard to understand"  -- how do we understand at all what is going on inside there?  Would that help us have empathy?  To feel less uncomfortable?
 * Policy network, value network, tree search -- three components of the system
 * How can it assess how likely a move would be by an opponent?  In what sense does it have empathy for us?
 * "This move made me think about Go in a new light" -- Lee Sedol on move 37, game 2
 * "It is reakky a very simple program, it isn't anywhere near full AI, and I already see people calling it he and she, unconsciously"
 * WHat is the difference betwween "Full AI" and AlphaGo.
 * Are we closer to a smart washing machine than to general AI?
 * How do we ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly?
 * What efforts are in place to make it ethical, responsible, safe.
 * "If AlphaGo wins, maybe we'll finally get to see what Go is all about"
 *

`Superintelligence <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOOCGB2/>`_, by Nick Bostrom.

Super interesting book about pathways to developing superintelligence, both of the wholly "artificial" kind and of the augmented human kind, as well as considerations of the dangers and timelines of each of these approaches.

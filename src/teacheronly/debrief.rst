 1. A couple of students still have significant installation issues.  Getting this part of the process handled ahead of time in the 9th grade image will be critical, which means tooling decisions will need to be made a full year out of the required 10th grade core course.
 2. This particular setup has a *lot* of cognitive load.  Finding ways to reduce that will be critical, especially in the required context where learning support needs will be significant. 
 
   * Schoology to course website
   * Course  website to weekly and project materials
   * Course website links to github class invitation
   * Github account setup, login, and verification
   * Git client setup, login, and verification
   * Git client to pull project repository
   * Anaconda navigator to jupyter lab to navigate to project repository
   * jupyter lab manipulate files in project repository

   	a. Where is the working directory?
        b. What if I've got another jupyter instance running?
        c. What if I open the same file in more than one instance or more than one tab?
        d. Which version am I editing?
        e. Markdown vs. code cells
        f. Cells that have been run vs. cells that have not been run
        g. Order of execution
        h. Restarting the kernel or for other reasons variables going out of memory
        i. Saving files

   * Python overhead

        a. module imports
        b. inscrutable code words in the boilerplate
        c. Accessing data
        d. Manipulating data
        e. Generic details vs. specific details
        f. notional machine

   * Git client to stage, commit, and push

 3. A key thing is to find ways to short circuit this load
 4. I need to make sure they whiteboard, pseudocode, human-instruction for the actual tasks.  It seems to be quite effective to talk to them about "How would you do that task, if you were to do it yourself?  Okay, now translate, as specifically as you can, the instructions to accomplish that.  Okay, now add even more detail because you can't assume that the reader (the interpreter) will be able to read between the lines."  This is one of the cores of thinking computationally, and I haven't really forced it at all.  Not doing this turns the class into a code deciphering course rather than a liberal studies course.
 5. Classrooom management.  The big room is hard to get around in, and the experienced kids can very easily dominate the room.  Need to do some work on them and about them.  Look at what HMC did with intro CS.
 6. I do think the additional structure this time is a really good move.  They will definitely get more out of the course this time, but I've lost a little of the free-wheeling culture by doing so -- need to get back a little more of the digital humanities feel.
 7. I find it very hard to find good videos and enrichments -- they take too long to watch and there are too many potential issues with any particular resource.  Need help curating content.

 1. So this morning I (re)discovered Runestone Interactive and their hosted textbook platform.  It's amazing.  And probably what I should be using for the CT10 course.  I can have a text, assignments, quizzes, checkpoints, and a codeLens system all in one place.  You can even have audio commentary play as the code runs on a line-by-line basis.  I think the available textbooks would have to be remixed significantly for our purposes, though -- the short trimester, low contact time, no homework, and range of students make all the ones there problematic.  I'm going to show it to the deans and see about getting support to work on a text for it.

 2. The flowcharting assignment was tough for them -- they just think of "add all the items in a list" as an atomic operation.  But I still think it was a good thing to do.  Perhaps I need to adopt a style convention for them to teach them.

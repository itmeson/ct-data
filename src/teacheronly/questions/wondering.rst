Some of the questions and comments from day one

 * Will Apple make robots one day?  Or will Microsoft?
 * How did they make the technology so much smaller?
 * What are the political and economic impacts of AI, automation, etc.
 * Even if AI was created and then like went crazy and tried to do a whole Skynet thing, couldn't we just like turn off the power? Like Skynet could be killed by a thunder storm.
 * Is there a ceiling to this growth?
 * What might lead towards general AI? Machine learning, brain modelling, etc?
 * How do you think AI will affect the job situation for people in the world? Will there be less jobs? If so, what will people do?
 * Will knowledge of artificial intelligence be useful in all areas of work in the future, or just computer-related ones? 
 * Talk about the pluses and minuses of AI and have a discussion on it
 * What other research will be needed to be performed if we were to transfer the data in a human brain to a device of a similar size as an iPhone?
 * What kind of effect did the bank have on creating the ENIAC?
 * When will robots take over the work force?
 * How do you think the improvement sped up so much within industry? What caused such drastic change?
 * If the price of tech over the years has gone down, then why is the price of the iPhone going up?
 * How much smaller/thinner will phones get?
 * As you said, human brains are extremely complicated.  Do we have the capabilities to figure out how to program one?
 * Isn't there a physical limit (on the atomic scale) of how compressed we can store data and make processors? How close are we?
 * How many human brains could fit inside a computer?
 * How much of our brain is used for memory, and how much is used for adaptativeness / instincts / human nature?
 * What do you think about the availability of neural net algorithms like TensorFlow being open sourced?

from section 2

 * How much RAM is needed to make a 100% self-driving car?
 * Even though the human brain is "better" than modern computers, is computer memory more reliable?
 * Based on current human progression, when will AI surpass human intelligence?
 * Is there a point where technological advancement slows down because we have reached maximum efficiency for a certain product?
 * What is a kilobyte vs. a megabyte?
 * AI world domination
 * Can/will smartphones ever hold unlimited gigabytes?
 * If we were to create digital human brains, would they carry the same hormones that evoke our emotions?
 * Why are people so scared about AI? Is it because of them taking our jobs, or movies about taking over the world?
 * Could you take the neurons and connections in your brain and implement a few into your smartphone so that it can create more connections/storage? Or is that completely unrelated?
 * A lot of people I know are afraid of Siri, Bixby, Alexa, and Google Home listening and recording their conversations
 * If in 36 years phones will have 2.5 petabytes of storage, will developers stop caring how big their apps/programs are?
 * Does the time frame of technological improvement decrease over time?
 * Does advancement become exponential?
 * Is there a way to figure out how to use more of our enormous energy?
 * In 35 years will the device function like our brain or just have the same memory?
 * What is the role of technological advancement and is it exponential?
 * Will it be possible in the foreseeable future to offload data from the human brain?
 * How many types of "bytes" are there?
 * When was the first computer made?
 * Where do you think computers and phones will have progressed in 35 years?
 * Is there anything bigger than a petabyte?
 * You said this class would be more like a humanities programming class, explain?
 * I don't have much to say other than this class is so cool.
 * Also, it's interesting to compare old computers to modern day computers like laptops instead of just phones
 * Are we gonna talk about 5G connectivity?
